- Marquee (Trusted by leaders)
    - Production path uses pure CSS loop for smooth GPU compositing:
        - .partners-marquee-track with animation marquee-ltr (translateX(-50%) → 0%)
        - Logos duplicated in the array to create a continuous loop
    - If you prefer a code-driven marquee, ui/PartnersMarquee.tsx implements a right-to-left auto-scroll with drag-to-pause, sub-pixel accumulation and wrapping (currently not mounted)
- Styling and utilities (src/app/globals.css)
    - partner-card box shadow and color balance for clean edges
    - partners-marquee-viewport padding for shadow fade

    - Home and Contact pages mount BusinessContactForm
    - Quote page maps legacy fields to API schema
    - Honeypot field website included on submit
- Performance
    - next/image everywhere for responsive/optimized assets
    - CSS-only marquee reduces JS work on mobile
    - will-change applied to marquee track for stable compositing
- CI/CD and operations
    - GitHub workflow .github/workflows/deploy.yml supports token-based “vercel deploy --prod”
    - For manual deploys use CLI; monitor via Vercel dashboard [Deployments tab](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-dashboard)
    - Logs and runtime inspection available in the dashboard [Runtime logs](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-dashboard)
- Security and deliverability
    - Resend requires SPF/DKIM/DMARC on the sender domain; avoid open/click tracking if Outlook deliverability issues persist
    - Honeypot reduces bot submissions; consider reCAPTCHA v3 if spam increases
- Notes and toggles
    - Footer “Technology” link hidden (commented) until content ready
    - ui/PartnersMarquee.tsx retained for experimentation but not currently mounted in prod (CSS loop in use)
    - Prisma dependency is present but not used by the email flow; safe to remove if not needed elsewhere
- Suggested next steps
    - Add analytics/insights in Vercel’s dashboard [Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-dashboard)
    - Add monitoring for email delivery (Resend webhooks or dashboard)
    - Integrate Supabase persistence in production if you want a permanent submissions archive
